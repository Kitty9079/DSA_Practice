## LL: Partition List

```python
 def partition_list(self, x):
        if not self.head:
            return None
    
        dummy1 = Node(0)
        dummy2 = Node(0)
        prev1 = dummy1
        prev2 = dummy2
        current = self.head
    
        while current:
            if current.value < x:
                prev1.next = current
                prev1 = current
            else:
                prev2.next = current
                prev2 = current
            current = current.next
    
        prev1.next = None
        prev2.next = None
        prev1.next = dummy2.next
    
        self.head = dummy1.next
```

This function is designed to partition a linked list around a value `x`, such that all nodes with values less than `x` come before nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`.

Consider a sample linked list and value for partitioning:
```
List: 5 → 3 → 8 → 2 → 10 → 4 → 1
Partition Value (x): 4
```

After partitioning, the linked list should look like:
```
3 → 2 → 1 → 5 → 8 → 10 → 4
```

**Method Walkthrough:**
```python
def partition_list(self, x):
```

- Check if the list is empty:
```python
if not self.head:
    return None
```
- If the list is empty, there's nothing to partition, so we `return None`.



- Initialize two dummy nodes and corresponding pointers:
```python
dummy1 = Node(0)
dummy2 = Node(0)
prev1 = dummy1
prev2 = dummy2
```
We are going to use two separate linked lists: 
  - one for values less than `x` (handled by dummy1 and prev1) 
  - and another for values greater than or equal to `x` (handled by dummy2 and prev2).



**Start at the head of the original list:**
```python
current = self.head
```
This current pointer will help us traverse the original linked list.



**Traverse the list and partition the nodes:**
```python
while current:
    if current.value < x:
        prev1.next = current
        prev1 = current
    else:
        prev2.next = current
        prev2 = current
    current = current.next
```
We use a loop to traverse the entire linked list. For each node, if its value is less than x, we append it to the list headed by dummy1. If it's greater than or equal to x, we append it to the list headed by dummy2.



**Terminate both lists:**
```python
prev1.next = None
prev2.next = None
```

Since we've possibly moved some nodes from the original list to our two new lists, we need to ensure that both new lists are properly terminated by setting their last node's `next` pointers to `None`.



**Connect the two lists:**
```python
prev1.next = dummy2.next
```
We attach the start of the second list (i.e., the list of values greater than or equal to `x`) to the end of the first list.



**Update the head of the linked list:**
```python
self.head = dummy1.next
```


We update the head of the original list to point to the head of our partitioned list (i.e., the first node with a value less than x).



**Conclusion: The `partition_list` method efficiently partitions a linked list around a value `x` by using `two temporary linked lists`: `one for nodes with values less than x and another for nodes with values greater than or equal to x`. After partitioning, it connects these two lists together and updates the original list's head to reflect the newly partitioned list. In our example, the linked list gets rearranged to have all nodes less than 4 come before nodes with values greater than or equal to 4.**
