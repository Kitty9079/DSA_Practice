# Queue Using Stacks: Dequeue 
```python
def dequeue(self):
        if self.is_empty():
            return None
        else:
            return self.stack1.pop()
```
This code is the implementation of the `dequeue` method for a queue data structure implemented using two stacks.

The purpose of the `dequeue` method is to remove and return the first element in the queue. In this implementation, the first element is always at the bottom of `stack1`.

The code first checks if the queue is empty using the `is_empty` method. If the queue is empty, the method returns `None` because there are no elements to remove.

If the queue is not empty, the method removes and returns the last element in `stack1` using the `pop` method. This is because the first element in the queue is always at the bottom of `stack1`, and `pop` removes elements from the end of a list.

Overall, this implementation of `dequeue` is efficient because it only requires popping elements from `stack1`. Any elements that were moved to `stack2` during the `enqueue` operation are moved back to `stack1` before the next `dequeue` operation, so there is no need to access `stack2` in this method.
